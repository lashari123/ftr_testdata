                        1. <u> Service.</u><br/>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A.&nbsp; <u>General Description:</u> : Frontier SmartVoice Service (“SmartVoice”) is a business voice communications service using Internet Protocol (“<b>IP</b>”) technology. It provides voice communications between a station on the Customer’s Local Area Network (“<b>LAN</b>”) and (a) for Services provisioned over a third-party network, a station on the Public Switched Telephone Network (“<b>PSTN</b>”); (b) for Services provisioned over Frontier’s network, a station on Frontier’s converged Services network, in each case using IP technology. SmartVoice Service provides basic IP voice communications standard features such as completing calls to the PSTN, abbreviated dialing and basic calling features/call management services; and access to 9-1-1 Emergency Service, subject to the limitations and terms described herein.
                        
                        <br/><br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; B.&nbsp; <u>Availability, Limitations, and Exclusions. : </u> 
                        <br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i. &nbsp; &nbsp;<u> Service Availability: </u>Customer’s eligibility to receive IP Service, Customer’s Local Area Network (“LAN”) environment must be at least 10Mb/100Mb/1000Mb Ethernet; LAN ports used for voice must be set to full-duplex; Customer’s LAN must have adequate bandwidth and ports to support the minimum amount of concurrent voice and data traffic ordered by Customer.
                        <br/> <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ii. &nbsp; &nbsp;<u> Limitations: </u> Customer understands that use of the Services is restricted in the following manner: (a) at any given time, Customer may only place as many concurrent calls as it has purchased simultaneous calling capacity; (b) Customer’s modification of Frontier installed design and/or configuration is at Customer’s risk; (c) Customer may not utilize auto-dialers or any similar type of device in connection with Frontier SmartVoice  Service; (d) Customer may not utilize SmartVoice Service in any call center environment or in connection with any similar such application; and (e) Customer may not use  SmartVoice Service for telemarketing, fax broadcasting, fax blasting, or continuous or extensive call forwarding. CUSTOMER EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANY VIOLATION OF THE FOREGOING RESTRICTIONS ON ITS USE OF THE SERVICE WILL IMMEDIATELY VOID AND INVALIDATE FRONTIER’S OBLIGATIONS AND PROVISION OF SERVICE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND WILL RESULT IN THE IMMEDIATE TERMINATION OF THE SERVICE BY FRONTIER. 
                        <br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; iii. &nbsp; &nbsp;<u> Exclusions . </u> The Service does not include reliability, redundancy, disaster recovery or business continuity features, functions, capabilities or services. The Service is provided over broadband networks, as a reasonable best efforts service without warranty, guarantees or service level commitments. Customer will not be able to make or receive calls with the Service if the Frontier network or DSL service is down or impaired or if any third-party network or service used in conjunction with the Service is down or impaired. Service may also be adversely impacted by congestion on the Customer’s LAN, Frontier’s network or DSL service and/or third- party network or service. 
                        <br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C. &nbsp; &nbsp;<u> Changes. </u>Throughout the Service Term, Customer may add subsequent lines at the rates and terms applicable under this Service Schedule, reduce the number of lines reflected in this Service Schedule without payment of the termination charge (please note, cancellation of entire account will be subject to the early termination charge), or make modifications to existing Services provided that such changes may be subject to a change fee (collectively “Changes”). Customer may request Changes via telephone, provided that Frontier may (but will not be required to) ask Customer to validate such Change request via email or other document. All such Changes and the resulting Services will be subject to the terms and conditions of this Schedule. 
                        <br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; D. &nbsp; &nbsp;<u> Training. </u> If Customer orders Equipment from Frontier for use with the SmartVoice Service, such Equipment purchase will be based on the terms and conditions outlined in Frontier’s standard Equipment purchase schedule (“Equipment Schedule”).  In the event that onsite training is requested, additional charges will apply and must be noted as an exception to the standard Installation Services Scope of Work. 
                        <br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. &nbsp; &nbsp;<u> <b>Service Term Renewal. </b> </u>&nbsp; &nbsp; <u> Notwithstanding Section 2 of the FSA, </u> if neither party provides the other with written notice of its intent to terminate at least sixty (60) days prior to completion of the Service Term, the Service Term shall automatically renew for consecutive periods equivalent to the Service Term identified in this Schedule, and at the then applicable rate, excluding promotional rates.

Further, Customer acknowledges and agrees that e-911 service will not be available, and Frontier assumes no liability: (a) if there is a power failure or some other type of failure of the equipment installed at the Service Location; (b) if there is a failure or congestion of the access connection (such as dsl or t-1 connection) or associated equipment provided to connect the Service Location to the VOIP service network; (c) if there is a failure or congestion of the VOIP network providing Customer’s VOIP service, the public switched telephone network (pstn), the 911 service provider’s network or the emergency services network; (d) if Customer is using the Services outside of the United States; (e) if Customer has moved the VOIP device, delayed in providing or failed to provide accurate location information to Frontier, or the information provided has not yet been updated by or is inaccurate; (f) if the Services have been disconnected or suspended for non-payment or any other reason; (g) for those circumstances under which 911 service may be limited to traditional 911 service rather than enhanced 911 (or ‘e-911’). With e-911 the Customer address and callback information is automatically provided to the emergency services systems; or (h) failure of emergency services under certain circumstances, including but not limited to, those circumstances in which Customer is using call forwarding, call redirection or blocking services, and/or when the emergency callback number is configured to ring a phone at a different location than the Customer’s VOIP device. If e-911 service is not available in Customer’s area or at the time of the 911 call, then, the system may default to traditional 911 service and the Customer may be required to verbally inform the 911 call taker or emergency responder of their address and phone number.	
                        <br/> <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; iv. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;911 service is offered solely as an aid in contacting an appropriate PSAP in connection with fire, police and other emergencies.<b> FRONTIER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSSES, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, SUITS OR ANY LIABILITY WHATSOEVER, WHETHER SUFFERED, MADE, INSTITUTED OR ASSERTED BY CUSTOMER OR BY ANY OTHER PARTY OR PERSON FOR ANY PERSONAL INJURY TO OR DEATH OF ANY PERSON OR PERSONS, AND FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION OF ANY PROPERTY, WHETHER OWNED BY CUSTOMER OR OTHERS, CAUSED OR CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY: (a) MISTAKES, OMISSIONS, </b>
